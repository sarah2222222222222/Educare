#  EDUcare – Inclusive AI-Powered Learning Platform

**EDUcare** is my graduation project: an AI-powered educational web platform designed to support **students with and without special needs** by providing personalized learning experiences. The system blends the features of **Google Classroom** and **ClassDojo**, enhanced with AI tools for automatic material generation, quiz creation, and smart performance tracking.

> 🎓 I built this project using **FastAPI**, **HTML/CSS/JS**, **LangChain**, and **Together AI**.  
> 🔐 All sensitive API keys are protected via `.env` files and never exposed to the public.

##  Key Features & How I Implemented Them

### 1. 🤖 AI Chatbot
- **What it does:** Helps students understand topics, stay motivated, and get quick answers.
- **Tech used:** FastAPI + LangChain + Together AI.
- **Implementation:** Created a FastAPI endpoint to handle messages, integrated LangChain to format prompts, and connected to Together AI’s LLM for intelligent responses. The frontend uses JavaScript for dynamic interaction.

### 2. 📄 PDF Upload & Summarization
- **What it does:** Students or teachers can upload learning materials in PDF format and get summarized versions.
- **Tech used:** PyMuPDF + LangChain.
- **Implementation:** PDF text is extracted using PyMuPDF, processed through LangChain, and returned as a summarized output. Frontend allows easy file upload.

### 3. 📝 Assignment Generator
- **What it does:** Generates quiz questions (MCQs, short answers) from user-provided material.
- **Tech used:** LangChain + Together AI.
- **Implementation:** Users input text or upload materials. An endpoint calls LangChain with a structured prompt to generate questions using Together AI.

### 4. 📚 Study Material Generator
- **What it does:** Produces simplified and personalized learning content for any topic.
- **Tech used:** FastAPI + Together AI.
- **Implementation:** A FastAPI endpoint accepts a subject/topic and returns structured material generated by the LLM. This helps students focus on the core concepts.

### 5. 🛡️ Secure API Key Handling
- **What it does:** Keeps sensitive keys (e.g. Together AI API key) hidden from the public.
- **How I handled it:**
  - Created a `.env` file to store API keys.
  - Used `python-dotenv` to load variables securely in `main.py`.
  - `.env` is included in `.gitignore` to prevent exposure on GitHub.
